Hello, I’m Justin. I am a full stack Rails Software Engineer 🤓, Tango Dancer 💃🏻,
and [Cooking Enthusiast](https://undergroundkitchensf.com) 👨🏻‍🍳 and currently working remotely from Berlin, Germany.
I used to be a mechanical design engineer, but decided to move into software development after backpacking.
I grew up in California and graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I spend my free time dancing tango, cooking delicious food, and working on [TangotubeTV](https://tangotube.tv) (A passion project of mine).
