title: About Me
---

I grew up in California and worked as a mechanical design engineer in
silicon valley for about 5 years. I took some time off to travel and do some
soul searching. I fell in love with dancing and it led me on an adventure around
the world. I have always had a passion for building awesome things and decided
that to pivot into web development. I moved to Berlin, Germany back in 2019 and
it's been my home ever since.
